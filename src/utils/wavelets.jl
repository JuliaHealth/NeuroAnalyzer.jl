"""
    _cwtfrq(s; <keyword arguments>)

Return the mean frequencies of a collection of analytic or real wavelets for a signal of a given length.

The first frequency bin is set to `0.0` Hz because `getMeanFreq` returns a non-physical low-frequency artifact for the lowest scale.

# Arguments

- `s::AbstractVector`: signal vector; used only for its length
- `fs::Int64`: sampling rate in Hz; must be ≥ 1
- `wt::T where {T <: CWT}=wavelet(Morlet(2π), β=2)`: wavelet to use; see the [ContinuousWavelets.jl documentation](https://github.com/dsweber2/ContinuousWavelets.jl) for the full list of available wavelets

# Returns

- `Vector{Float64}`: center frequencies in Hz (rounded to 2 decimal places), length determined by the number of wavelet scales

"""
    _cwtfrq(s; <keyword arguments>)

Return the mean frequencies of a collection of analytic or real wavelets for a 3-D signal array.

Delegates to the vector method using the first channel and first epoch `s[1, :, 1]` to determine the wavelet frequency grid (all channels and epochs share the same grid for a fixed signal length).

# Arguments

- `s::AbstractArray`: signal array, shape (channels, samples, epochs)
- `fs::Int64`: sampling rate in Hz; must be ≥ 1
- `wt::T where {T <: CWT}=wavelet(Morlet(2π), β=2)`: wavelet to use; see the [ContinuousWavelets.jl documentation](https://github.com/dsweber2/ContinuousWavelets.jl) for the full list of available wavelets

"""
    cwtfrq(obj; <keyword arguments>)

Return the mean frequencies of a collection of analytic or real wavelets for a NEURO object.

Uses the first channel and first epoch to determine the wavelet frequency grid.

# Arguments

- `obj::NeuroAnalyzer.NEURO`: input NEURO object
- `wt::T where {T <: CWT}=wavelet(Morlet(2π), β=2)`: wavelet to use; see the [ContinuousWavelets.jl documentation](https://github.com/dsweber2/ContinuousWavelets.jl) for the full list of available wavelets
